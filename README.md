# Python-Projects
 Basic Projects I made in Python using various modules of tkinter and sqlite3.

<h2>Projects:</h2>
 <ul>
 <li>Phonebook</li>
 <li>Check Files GUI</li>
 </ul>
 
 <h3>Phonebook</h3>
 <p>This project functions as a phonebook for a user. It saves a contact's name, phone number, and email address in a databse and allow the user to update and delete previously stored entries!
 <br>
 <h3>Check Files GUI</h3>
 <p>This project allows the user to transfer all files from one folder to another, saving all moved files in a database.
